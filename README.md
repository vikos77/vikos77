## Bioinformatics Researcher | Antimicrobial Resistance | Bacterial Defence Systems

MSc Bioinformatics graduate bridging wet-lab microbiology with computational genomics. Specializing in bacterial defense system architecture and its implications for antimicrobial resistance.

### Current Research Focus

Acinetobacter Defence Systems: Analyzing 500+ bacterial genomes to map defence system distribution and their correlation with antibiotic resistance genes using DefenseFinder and PADLOC pipelines.

## Repositories
### 1. [Acinetobacter-Defence-Systems](https://github.com/vikos77/Acinetobacter-defence-systems)

Comprehensive analysis of defense system architecture in Acinetobacter species

**Tools**: DefenseFinder, PADLOC, CRISPRCasFinder, ResFinder

**Languages**: R, Bash

**Key Finding**: Identified novel correlations between defence, anti-defence systems, mobile genetic elements and antibiotic resistance genes.

### 2. [Acinetobacter-Defence-Pipeline](https://github.com/vikos77/acinetobacter-defence-pipeline)
